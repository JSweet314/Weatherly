The primary goal of this project was to introduce us to React.js and to get us working with a live API, both of which will be helpful in Mod3 as well as the rest of our careers as developers. Secondary goals were working with React testing, as well as getting us used to building a front facing application again. Though this was a challenging project, it was fun to be able to use React, which is a powerful and interesting tool for building webapps.
